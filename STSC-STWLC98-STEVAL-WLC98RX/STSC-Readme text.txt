ST Super Charge Protocol 

Please refer to the STEVAL-WLC98RX user manual for instructions on how to load the "STWLC98_STSC_step_sequencer.bin" file and run the STSC protocol using the STSW-WPSTUDIO software.


Note:

Turn on the E-load with No load (0A) or 0.1A before putting the Rx on the Tx.
Increase the load from 0.1A to 2.5A with the step of 0.1A.
When Rx working at high power, MUST NOT suddenly decrease or turn off the load.
If you want to stop wireless charging, you can decrease the load gradually and then remove the receiver (Rx).
